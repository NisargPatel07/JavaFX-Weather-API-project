# Weather Application (JavaFX)

## Overview
This project is a simple weather application built using Java and JavaFX. It connects to a public weather API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input. The app displays basic weather information in a clean and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- JavaFX  
- REST API  
- JSON Parsing  

## How It Works
- The user enters a city name.
- The application sends a request to a weather API.
- The API returns current weather data.
- The app displays temperature and weather conditions on the screen.

## Project Structure
- JavaFX.java – Handles the user interface and application flow  
- MyWeatherAPI.java – Manages API requests and processes weather data  

## How to Run
1. Compile all `.java` files  
2. Run the JavaFX application  
3. Enter a city name to view current weather details  

## Learning Outcomes
- Working with external APIs  
- Building graphical user interfaces with JavaFX  
- Handling user input and API responses  
- Structuring a clean Java project  

## Project Type
Individual project focused on API integration and GUI development.
